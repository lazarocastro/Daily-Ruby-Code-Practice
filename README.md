# Daily-Ruby-Code-Practice
This is a repository of Ruby Codes for study.

During the study I use two Ruby Gems to show me what happening into the code:

[Rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec)

[Seeing_is_believing](https://github.com/JoshCheek/seeing_is_believing)

I really recomend to install those gems, they are very usefull.
